Here you will find some projects built on React, Next.js, Node, NestJS, etc. I like to put in practice everything I learn, because without it, you don't really learned it. Some of the projects are original creations, and some were created during community events like rocketseat's NLW.

<!-- I've found in programming a superpower, where you can create solutions that help others and unleash your creativity building anything you want or need. 
The first techlonogy I've learned was plain HTML, building websites with 12 years old. Then added some CSS and javascript on thoose same websites. 
After some years, I have started to learn Graphic Design, Front end Development with React and Back End development with NodeJS. Basically, I spent my 
last two years learnining on a non-stop mode, Next.js, NodeJS, Typescript, clean archtechture, design patterns, and a lot more. Recently started to learn 
and develop with NestJS.

I'm currently enrolled in a Software Engineering Bachelor, where I can revist the basics and get a strong foundation. Bu as always, learning cutting edge technologiesm, and developing projects where I can put that knowledge in action.

I'm also working as a full-time developer on UNIGRAN, one of the biggest and best Universities on my state (Mato Grosso do Sul - Brasil). Here I'm developing
solutions for the academics and the internal team, in the same technologies: Next.js, Node.js and postgres. -->
